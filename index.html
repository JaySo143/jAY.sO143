<h1>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</h1>


<h2>The Super Mario Bros. Movie was released in theaters in April 7th, 2023. Directed by Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic, and created by Illumination and Nintendo.</h2>

<p>The movie revolves with the well known plumber we all know and love, Mario, who embarks on an adventure with Princess Peach after his brother has been captured by Bowser and his minions.</p>

<p>Now, there is another Mario Bros movie, but it was regarded as one of the worst films ever made, and plus I haven't even watched that movie before, so this CGI "remake" is going to better than the live action one in the 90's.</p>
